<description><![CDATA[
<p>I have always had issues writing. This particular form of
communication has always seemed quite alien to me. But it is now time
for me to improve this particular <em>skill</em> mostly because I have
realised that it is quite an important ability to master in the long
run. There are multiple benefits of being able to express yourself
efficiently both academically and otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="who-am-i">Who am I ?</h3>
<p>I am a Law Student in India pursuing matters of Constitutional Law
and Social Justice. I have a keen interest in philosophy and sociology
too, in addition to an interest in Lacanian and Freudian psychology.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-i-indend-to-do-here">What do I indend to do here ?</h3>
<p>I wish to use this particular platform as a way to not only develop
on my writing skills but also develop on my own aspects of research and
academic inquiry. I indend to write on matters of law, philosophy and
politics, and the interesting interconnections between them. The posts
may be opinionated which I invite you to question and deconstruct. I
also intend to maintain a regularity with respect to the frequency with
which I publish here. I also would appriciate an open dialog between Me
and You (yes you the reader!) so feel free to email me if you have
anything to say about the topics that I have written about.</p>
