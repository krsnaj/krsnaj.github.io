<p align=justify>I have been angry and frustrated at the abhorrent state of the
internet for quite some time now. It has been irritating to see the
modern trends in web development steering away from the foundational
idea with which the web was created. The internet has now become a
playground for big tech corporations rather than being a democratised
platform for self-expression. Today most platforms that have today
become a "place of ideas" are also controlled by a huge tech
corporation. X, Medium and Instagram are cases in point. The web has
left its federated nature. At one point all those that wished to have
their ideas on "the web", needed to have their own websites which were a
private space for self-expression. As Hegel said property is an
expression of freedom, of independence. It is also a expression of ones
own individuality. That unfortunately finds no place in todays
"Web".</p>
<p align=justify>There are two parts of this issue that I would like to address. The
first is a technical matter that deals with the technologies used in web
development today and the other is a more philosophical argument on the
centralisation of ideas. The problem with web development today is
essentially the fact that it has become extremely maximalist. The time
spent on the website today has become a very important metric for those
that wish to make monetary gains from their web platforms. This means
that the more visually appealing and enchanting the website looks the
more our monkey brains are going to spend time looking at it. A very
scary trend in this respect is telemetry through cookies which is used
by websites to track their users and understand their use patterns. This
is then shared with other websites which then allows them to cater
their content specifically based on user patters. The recent "analytics"
trend is indicative of such change. Most content creators today focus
greatly on the ways in which people respond to certain keywords and then
strategically use them on their websites to rope in unsuspecting users.
This has also had a great effect on the performance of the Web as a
information sharing platform. While in the early days the Web was made
up of simple HTML pages with text and/or multimedia, the internet was
also accessible through simple dial up connections which did not go
beyond a few megabytes. Today it is the opposite. The average consumer
uses around 1GiB of data per day as per telecom plans here in India. A
simple experiment can further help elucidate this point. I invite you to
record the time it takes for you web browser to visit the websites of
CNN, BBC, The Hindu etc, and the time it takes to load up my website.
The difference is shocking. Not only that, Google AdSense is causing a
lot of the damage we see today, not only in the sphere of web
advertisements but also in the space of web privacy cookies and web
telemetry. The ease with which anyone can use Google AdSense to place
advertisements on their website and use it to monetise their platform
has caused great issues in the way the Web works today. It has made most
website unbearable with the abominable amount of ads that websites
serve to their users today<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. The focus on making the
web simpler is also an attempt to make the web a more quick and
efficient source of information.</p>
<p align=justify>On the philosophical question I will speak less. I am shocked at the
way in which we are ready to part with our individual autonomy, which
also means our autonomy as a society, while being a part of a
centralised system of ideas. Today as a society we must tread with
caution. Physical places which facilitate interaction, exchange of ideas
and public discourse are way more difficult to censor. Habermas talks
about how the cafe’s in Paris became an important centre of political
engagement. They became small microcosms that engaged with the
contemporary issues of their time in their own way and were in no
compulsion from any other agent. The power of such public engagement is
being undermined today. With reports of censorship on various platforms
because of “Terms of Service” violations are alarming when used for
political ends. I donot blame those in power that use it, mostly because
we as a community have given them that power. Today social engagement is
in reality so fragile that today that a power outage can dismantle and
disrupt the entire house of cards. This is the reality that I am afraid
of, and this website is my own way of fighting such oppression</p>

<p>I have always had issues writing. This particular form of
communication has always seemed quite alien to me. But it is now time
for me to improve this particular <em>skill</em> mostly because I have
realised that it is quite an important ability to master in the long
run. There are multiple benefits of being able to express yourself
efficiently both academically and otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="who-am-i">Who am I ?</h3>
<p>I am a Law Student in India pursuing matters of Constitutional Law
and Social Justice. I have a keen interest in philosophy and sociology
too, in addition to an interest in Lacanian and Freudian psychology.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-i-indend-to-do-here">What do I indend to do here ?</h3>
<p>I wish to use this particular platform as a way to not only develop
on my writing skills but also develop on my own aspects of research and
academic inquiry. I indend to write on matters of law, philosophy and
politics, and the interesting interconnections between them. The posts
may be opinionated which I invite you to question and deconstruct. I
also intend to maintain a regularity with respect to the frequency with
which I publish here. I also would appriciate an open dialog between Me
and You (yes you the reader!) so feel free to email me if you have
anything to say about the topics that I have written about.</p>
